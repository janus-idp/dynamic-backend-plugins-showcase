  title: Get Browser Event Sink Tool URL
  description: |
    This template retrieves the URL of the **Browser Event Sink** tool.
    
    The **Browser Event Sink tool** is contributed by a plugin, and:
    - exposes a dedicated front-end page at the given URL,
    - forwards `test-dynamic-plugins` events received by backstage to the front-end through `socket.io`.

    _Note: All these features, as well as the `http-request` scaffolder action used in this template, are provided as dynamic plugins._
